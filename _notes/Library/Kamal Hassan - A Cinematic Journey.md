Cover resembles Baradwaj Rangan's Conversations with Mani Ratnam. Unlike the conversational format of Mani Ratnam's book, this one is composed of articulated essays. He effectively draws parallels with Tamil politics. One drawback is the lack of emphasis on Crazy Mohan and the slapstick, dialogue - based humor that the Crazy Mohan-Kamal Hassan duo delivered.
