P.N.K Panicker possesses a ghost-gifted talent for weaving ghost stories. His son, Suresh Eriyat, an acclaimed animator, collaborated with Adithi Krishnadas to transform this talent into a remarkable piece of art—a captivating animated short film titled Kandittund (Seen It!). It's no surprise that this masterpiece earned the National Award for Best Animation Film.
