C.S. Chellappaâ€™s classic story on Jallikattu - blending humans, animals, pride, and violence, gets a powerful retelling by Perumal Murugan (Translated to English by N Kalyana Raman) in this graphic novel. Brought to life with striking black-and-white art by Appupen, this is one of the finest visual interpretations of a deeply political and iconic Tamil story. A must BUY!
