I can't read Tamil well, but I love Tamil audiobooks, especially ones I’ve already read in Malayalam or English. This was my first time experiencing a work directly in Tamil, and it was amazing. A simple yet deep story about people, hunger, and food. Set in Thiruvananthapuram, which made it easy to picture.
