Visual thinkers are not visualisers.  Visual thinkers need visual cues to process information effectively. They excel at interpreting existing visuals but struggle to generate images from verbal descriptions. On the other hand, visualisers possess the ability to construct images from information. They can "see" a design.

Tailoring your communication style to accommodate both groups can lead to more effective design discussions and outcomes.
