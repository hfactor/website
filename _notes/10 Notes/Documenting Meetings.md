Meeting notes should focus on clear information. Keep them simple so you can remember details later. Every meeting involves people, and conversations usually fall into a few categories. I use these basic principles to quickly summarize meetings.

I prefer using [Obsidian Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) or [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)'s Daily page for daily notes, rather than creating a separate note for each meeting. I divide each meeting into headings and use tags to mark important points (e.g., Summary, Design, Question, Answer, and Decision). At work, I keep a to-do list within Logseq.

If it's something to *hype* about later, I tag it to my [[Hype Doc]]. 

### File Example : 
```
File : 10-Feb-2023.md

## 11:00 1:1 with [[Person A]]
	- #SUMMARY Summary of the meeting goes here. Not Minutes.
	- [[PROJECT1]] will have seperate touch notes, for easier search.
	- #QUESTION Bigger questions that comes in meeting. 
		- #ANSWER If someone answer. More answers are added.
	- #DECISION Anything we all decide 
	- TODO Tasks related to meeting

```
