For the last seven years, I've used notebooks and journals for planning and thinking. Digital to-do apps never worked for me. They made me feel exhausted and overwhelmed. ([[Pick your tools that serve purpose]]). 

### Current Format
1. I use a small, [FieldBook-like notebook with 64 pages](https://amzn.to/3XYAaj8). It's compact and easy to carry. This journal usually lasts 3-4 weeks. [[Accessibility is the first rule of Functionality]].
2. I find popular [[Bullet Journaling]] layouts complicated. My layout is a simple one-column format, using pen or pencil.
3. I use the notebook from both ends. One side is for planning and tasks, the other for capturing ideas and reflections. This separates my planning from creative thinking. (Plus, tasks are often boring and not worth revisiting!)
4. Like [[Bullet Journaling]], I start both sections with a simple index page. [[Idea of having an Index Note]]. I number notes instead of pages, as one page can have many topics.
5. On the planning side, the index lists important work projects, personal projects, and travel plans. The ideas side focuses on topics, interests, and thoughts. [[Building a Boring Task List]].
6. I keep my old notebooks and look at them for new ideas or to understand my past thinking. This is why I started keeping to-do lists separate, as they often have routine tasks not worth revisiting. I also use a date-stamper on pages, liking how the printed text looks among handwritten notes. I usually add dates when reviewing notes.
