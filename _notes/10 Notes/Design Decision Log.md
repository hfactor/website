Documenting design is challenging, as it occurs at various product stages, from strategic conceptualisation to last-minute changes due to engineering limitations. Like [[Documenting Meetings]], it's helpful to track design evolution from a decision perspective.

I previously used a markdown-based change-log [[Changelog as a consistent communication tool]] for this. Now, I use a cloud-based spreadsheet for easier collaboration. It's a simple, single sheet focusing on: Component, Decision, Rationale with Date and  Link to screenshot or Figma. This format is easier to compile and search. Filtering by component and sorting by date provides clarity on the design's evolution.
