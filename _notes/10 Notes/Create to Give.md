Make things thinking about who will use them, not just about finishing a task. When you write, picture the person who will read it. When you cook, imagine who will eat the meal. When you build something, think of who will find it helpful.

Don't focus too much on making it perfect. Think instead about making it useful or bringing a smile to someone's face.  Sometimes we get stuck thinking about if our work is good enough. But when you make something as a gift, these worries matter less. You focus on what the other person needs or would enjoy. 

You also learn more this way. Each time you make something for someone, you understand more about what works and what doesn't. You see how different people use your work differently. These lessons make your next creation better.
