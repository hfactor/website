I use [Key Magic](https://keymagic.net/downloads/) with Mozhi Mapping to type phonetic Malayalam.Some times Mac might not allow you to install Keymagic from orginal source, in that case try download from [Mac Download](https://macdownload.informer.com/keymagic/) and install it.

- Go to `System Preference > Keyboard > Input Source` and add Keymagic, from `Multiple Languages` option. (There is a `+` icon, on bottom-left). 
- This will enable KeyMagic. Also, select 'Show Input Menu in Menu Bar'. 
- Now, to configure Key Magic, Select Key Magic from Menu bar, and click on it again. 
- You will see 'Open Keyboard Directory ' as an option. Click on that, which will open `.keymagic` folder.
- Download `Malayalam-Mozhi.km2` from [Narayam](https://code.google.com/archive/p/naaraayam/downloads) and paste that file to this folder. You can delete other .km2 files from the folder, to declutter the options.
- Now Keymagic will show Malayalam Mozhi as an option. Select that, and start typing!

## Typing using Malayalam Inscript

If you want to use [InScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InScript_keyboard) method instead of Mozhi, you can download [Malayalam-Inscript.km2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-zzYBMIntMxVkd0NXpLVGhSUms?resourcekey=0-XJsTz7bIVnpZ6l87mjVlNw) instead of Malayalam-Mozhi.km2
