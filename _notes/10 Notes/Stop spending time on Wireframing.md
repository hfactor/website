While Wire-framing using pen and paper is an interesting way of communication that helps in building clarity over the idea â€“ it is time-consuming for non-designers. Especially when non-designer manager uses it as a tool to communicate with designers. 

Also, wireframe is *instructive* than *suggestive*.

Tools like Balsamiq work very similar to Figma or Sketch, but with some restrictions, and the time a non-designer takes to build is usually high. To bring clarity over feature and edge-cases, it is better to use Breadboarding. By using [[Breadboarding over Wireframes]], there is a significant time saving, and it also provides designers more ground to think and solve design from a visual perspective.
