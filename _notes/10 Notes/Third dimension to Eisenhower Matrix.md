Eisenhower Matrix suggests dropping things that are not important or urgent, *but what if you want to do it?* (call a random friend and check how he/she is) 

It suggests delegating urgent but not-important tasks, but what if there is none to delegate? Fact is, we will be spending some time on bottom quadrant. Warikoo recommends adding a third dimension to this matrix -- TIME. He recommends to build clarity on how we spend time, and understanding on which quadrant we are spending it more, and optimise it so that it is utilised on right matters. 

These days, I follow [[LNO Framework]], instead of Eisenhower.
