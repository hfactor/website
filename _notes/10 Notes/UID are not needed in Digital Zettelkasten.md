Analog [[Zettelkasten]] recommends using a Unique ID on every literature note (as or along with the title) for search and discoverability. I find it an unwanted practice in digital zettels, as it's easier to build connected notes (hyperlinks and backlinks) in digital zettels. Also, UID makes titles less readable.
