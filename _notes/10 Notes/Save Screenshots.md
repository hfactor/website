An effective way to document design work, whether for a [[Design Decision Log]] or [[Hype Doc]], is to store screenshots. I initially undervalued this system, but it now provides Clarity on small wins and a quick view of evolutions/improvements over time

I currently archive screenshots in a `Year/Month/` format without renaming the files.
