1. Clearly define the meeting's purpose, whether it's to clarify doubts, share thoughts, align everyone, or debate differing viewpoints. 
2. Specify who should attend, their roles, and if they need to present or prepare, including optional attendees. 
3. Respect others' schedules by choosing a time that works for all, considering personal time, timezones, and breaks, while allowing flexibility in scheduling.
4. Provide a clear agenda with the meeting's purpose and relevant links, sharing resources and artefacts beforehand. 
5. Remember that [[Meetings are not the place to surprise people]]. 
6. Ensure everyone feels heard, even if not everyone speaks, and keep in mind that [[You don't have to be the first with an opinion]]. 
7. Always practice [[Documenting Meetings]]. 
8. For in-person meetings, minimise device use to avoid distractions. 
9. Choose either fully offline or fully remote formats, as [hybrid combines the worst of office and remote work](https://world.hey.com/dhh/hybrid-combines-the-worst-of-office-and-remote-work-d3174e50).
