Tools are useful only if they serve their purpose. Complex tools don't guarantee better results. Use tools that help you work more effectively.

For small, atomic notes that need searching, I use markdown format. For numbers and data, choose spreadsheets over markdown or text apps. Data can be processed later, and spreadsheets provide a straightforward, rigid template.
