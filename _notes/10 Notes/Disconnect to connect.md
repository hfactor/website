Our phones and laptops keep us busy all day. We check messages, scroll through feeds, and jump between apps without thinking. This constant checking eats up our time and scatters our attention. Try stepping away from your devices for a few hours each day. Turn off notifications and keep your phone in another room while working. **Take walks without any devices, read physical books, write in a paper notebook.** Sit quietly and watch the world around you. Meet friends without checking phones. Do one thing at a time, fully focused.

At first, you might feel restless or worry about missing something. This is normal. Give it time.  Start small - maybe 30 minutes without devices. The online world will still be there when you return. But you might find you need less of it than you thought.
