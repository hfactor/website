Systems, products, and templates fail if people can't use them effectively. Accessibility is key for all of these. Restrictions and friction can make tools inefficient.

- I like thinking on big sheets, but they were hard to carry and reference. I switched to a smaller, pocket-sized notebook. It's easier and helps me get things done. [[How I use Bullet Journal]]
