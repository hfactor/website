The format of writing can change based on the intention of writing. It can be rapid logging bullet points, like what [[Bullet Journaling]] recommends, or [[Outline Notes]] so that their structure is defined, or atomic notes recommended by [[Zettelkasten]], or its new-generation fork [[Evergreen Notes]]. Similarly, articulation can be targeted to the consumer.
