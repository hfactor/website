You might assume everyone knows about a certain feature or that explaining it would be redundant. But what's familiar to you may be new to others. They might have seen a pattern without truly understanding it. As a product designer, explaining the seemingly obvious often becomes necessary. 

Remember, your colleagues and stakeholders may not share your design vocabulary or UX principles. It's crucial to break down complex concepts into simple, relatable terms. Always provide context for your design decisions, showing how they fit into the broader user experience and business objectives. In these situations, focus on explaining the rationale. Design isn't just about aesthetics; it's about function and purpose. Make your reasoning clear through words and examples. 

Show the pattern you're referencing, compare it with other products, and demonstrate how those products work rather than just explaining. This approach caters to both visual thinkers and those who need to see a concept in action to fully grasp it. [[Visual Thinkers vs. Visualisers]].
