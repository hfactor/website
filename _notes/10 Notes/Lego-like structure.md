An easier way of understanding [[Atomicity]] is by comparing it with Lego Box. The Lego Box contains a set of 'blocks,' a basic unit of the game.

### Atomic Concept
1. Lego Blocks are the smallest component. You can't break it into the smaller component. 
2. By mix and match, you can build complex components. 
3. There is a defined consistency/rules; you have to follow those to build stable results. 
4. There are endless combinations. 
5. Lego sells it in 'thematic form.' One contains flight; the other contains a crane. - You can define a theme by choosing not to include out-of-scope elements.
