Design System is a collection of reusable Components, build using Atomicity and Sub-atomic Design Tokens particles that follow the guideline, behave consistently, and together work as the building block of the product. A design system is not a pattern library or a sticker sheet. Atoms being consistent or similar in a design system won't make the final result compatible. 

It requires a clear, documented guideline on behaviour and usage patterns. Usage patterns, organisms, and templates make the system scalable [[Design is Scaling]]. It follows [[Lego-like structure]] but does come with some themes and rules. *The combinations are not unlimited.* Consider the design system as the single source of truth that groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realise and develop a product.

Start with [[Scorecards to Pilot Design System Migration]] instead of over planning and underachieving.
