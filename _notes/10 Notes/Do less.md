The "Do Less" philosophy challenges the notion that constant busyness equals productivity. It's about focusing on what truly matters and letting go of unnecessary tasks. By doing less, we create space for more meaningful work and life experiences. This approach isn't about being lazy; it's about being intentional with our time and energy.  

Prioritise essential tasks, delegate when possible, and shelf ideas that aren't crucial. Learn to say no to unimportant commitments and embrace simplicity in daily routines. 

Allow time for rest and reflection, including at least 10 minutes of device-free, music-free wall-staring.
