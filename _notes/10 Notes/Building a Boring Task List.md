Every week (or when feeling blocked), I create a brain-dump of to-dos and tasks for the coming days. For active projects (Travel, Event, Design work), I use a one-letter code. It's an open list. After making the list, I prioritise based on Commitment, Impact, Urgency and Need. I also decide what to focus, delegate or postpone ([[LNO Framework]]). The general rule is to [[Do less]]. 

I used to follow the [[Bullet Journaling]] migration method. Now, I start from zero and compare with tasks from the last brain-dump. This helps me reevaluate each task and its importance.
