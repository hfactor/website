I recommend product people to create Breadboarding over Wireframing, as initial product documentation _especially to interact with designers_. Wireframes are too detailed. The extra detailing kills the possibility of abstraction. Wireframe focuses more on on-screen interactions (which provides designers less room for creativity) and not the workflow or the user journey (and this leads to estimation errors as [[Overspecification leads to estimation errors]])

[[Stop spending time on Wireframing]] and Breadboarding are better, faster way of idea interactions. If micro detailing is needed, it is better to go for [[Draw over the screenshot]].Also, [[Stop spending time on Wireframing]]
