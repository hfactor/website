Ship/Show/Ask is a branching strategy that combines the features of Pull Requests with the option to continue shipping changes.  There are three categories of changes in this method. They are **Ship** (Merge to main, without review), **Show** (PR and Merge to Main) and **Ask** (PR, then discuss, then merge). 

This provides advantages of both worlds as you can merge your own pull request without waiting for feedback, then act to feedback if/when it comes. Also, It encourages decision making to think about the change that we are making.
