This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/), a static site generator, and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/pages). It uses a forked version of the [Simply Jekyll](https://github.com/raghudotcc/simply-jekyll) theme. The theme is open source and available at [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io).

Content is written and organized in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a note-taking app based on plain text. The typefaces used are [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans/about) and [Manjari](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manjari/about), chosen for their clarity and warmth. The domain is currently managed via [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
