I’m spending time on UXFOSS and planning a few coffee workshops in Bangalore and Kochi. I’m also putting together a 2026 gift for friends and thinking about some end-of-year travel. I’m rearranging my book library, trying a no-buy streak for next 3 months, and catching up on books, ideas, and whatever curiosity throws my way.
