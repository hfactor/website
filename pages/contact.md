Let’s collaborate, jam on ideas, or work together. Whether you're looking for mentoring, design feedback, a workshop, or just want to connect—this is the place.

I occasionally mentor designers, founders, and early-stage teams. I enjoy helping with product thinking, design processes, team building, and strategy—especially in the 0→1 and 1→10 stages. I also run focused workshops and provide feedback on design work.
