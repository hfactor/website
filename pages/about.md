I've been working in design since 2010, leading teams and building products at the intersection of design, technology, and community. This year, I co-founded [UXFOSS](https://hiran.in/uxfoss), a community for people working on user experience in free and open source software.

My path into design started with curiosity about free software and early internet communities. That led me to [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in/), where I helped revamp the community and eventually designed [Dyuthi](https://smc.org.in/fonts/#dyuthi), one of the first fully-featured ornamental Unicode Malayalam typefaces. Later, I released [Rufscript](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/rufscript), a Latin display typeface.

I co-founded Saltmangotree, one of India's early digital marketing studios, where I led design and technology until it was acquired by a French company. The name comes from [a line in a Malayalam movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsU5-kndYHw)—a small inside joke that stuck around longer than we expected. Since then, I've worked across different contexts—leading and managing teams, building communication products, publishing tools, and civic tech platforms.

Over the years, I've worked on projects like [Malayaleegraphy](https://facebook.com/malayaleegraphy), [Chali Machine](https://behance.net/gallery/40300789/the-chali-machine), and [Kerala Designer Co.](https://www.instagram.com/kdco_official/) Most were experiments and collaborations, born from the urge to build something and see what happens.

For the past four years, I've been exploring home brewing—experimenting with methods, learning from what works and what doesn't, and occasionally hosting small sessions to share techniques and experiences with others. It's part of the same practice: try something, adjust, and see what emerges.
